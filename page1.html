<h1>Current Trends in Smart Robot Development</h1>
<h3>AI-Powered Robots
</h3>
<p class="article_paragraph">Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing robotics. By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, robots can now make decisions, solve problems, and even learn from their environment. This has led to smarter, more efficient robots capable of performing complex tasks without human intervention. AI-powered robots are now widely used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service.
  Unlike traditional robots that operate in isolation, collaborative robots, or cobots, are designed to work alongside humans. These robots can safely and efficiently perform repetitive or strenuous tasks while enhancing human productivity. Cobots are particularly popular in manufacturing and logistics, where they assist with assembly, packaging, and transportation.
